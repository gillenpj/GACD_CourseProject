Codebook for HARDataAvg
=======================

The derived data set was created by merging the training and  test data sets from the HAR database to create a single data set. Only mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted (step 2 in R-script). Each extracted variable was averaged for each activity and each subject (step 5 in R-script).

For a detailed description of the features measured in the HAR database, please refer to the file *features_info.txt* in the original data set.

Variables
=========

* *Subject*, identifier of each of the thirty volunteers in the HAR experiement

* *Activity*, description of each of the six activities performed by each voluneer

* *(prefix)(signal).(statistic)[.direction]*, measurement averaged for each subject and activity
  * *prefix* in {t, f}
  * *signal* in {BodyAcc, GravityAcc, BodyAccJerk, BodyGyro, BodyGyroJerk, BodyAccMag, GravityAccMag, BodyBodyAccJerkMag, BodyBodyGyroMag, BodyBodyGyroJerkMag}
  * *statistic* in {mean, std}
  * *direction* in {X, Y, Z}
 
Note, in the original data set, the Fast Fourier Transform, indicated by the prefix *f*, was not applied to the signals *GravityAcc*, *BodyGyroJerk*, and *GravityAccMag*.
